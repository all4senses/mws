Attribute field for line item
-----------------------------
This field allows the presentation of the product in the shopping cart by a 
separated view mode. A new product display is added. There you can define the 
fields which should be displayed for this product type in the shopping cart.


Edit option for attributes
--------------------------
By default when the customer press the link in the shopping cart he gets back 
to the product display. But the previous selected attributes are not selected. 
This features allows the customer to edit the line item and edit directly the 
previous selected attributes. The shopping cart will be then updated according 
to the changes.


Installation
------------
Install it as usual. Edit the shopping cart, the checkout and the order admin 
view and add the attribute field. There you can specify if a link to the product 
is displayed or not.
To setup the shown fields you need to edit the product displays in the product 
type.
